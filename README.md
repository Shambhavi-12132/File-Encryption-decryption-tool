# File-Encryption-decryption-tool
Introduction -
With increasing cybersecurity threats, protecting sensitive data has become crucial. This project, "Secure file Encryption and Decryption Tool," aims to ensure confidentiality by encrypting files and messages using modern encryption algorithms like AES and RSA. Encryption converts readable data into an unreadable format, while decryption reverses this process using a valid key. This tool is designed for both personal and professional use, providing an easy-to-use interface with strong security features.

 Problem statement -
In the digital age, sensitive data such as personal documents, business files, and confidential records are frequently shared and stored electronically. However, these files are vulnerable to unauthorized access, data breaches, and cyberattacks. Traditional security measures like password protection are often insufficient against advanced hackingÂ techniques.
